## About 
We have 3 model in this repository
### Plant Disease Detection
[Plant disease Detection ](https://github.com/akbarsigit/Pedotan-MachineLearning/blob/main/crop_disease_detection.ipynb) 
(image classification) use InceptionV3 as the base model for transfer learning that taken from [Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/). The model also contain additional layer that received ouput from based model. The model had 36 node to define its 36 classification category.  [Plant Disease Classification Merged Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alinedobrovsky/plant-disease-classification-merged-dataset) that contain 18.96 GB images of various plant disease. 

### Nutrient Deficiency Detection
- [Nutrient Deficiency Detection](https://github.com/akbarsigit/Pedotan-MachineLearning/blob/main/leafNutrient.ipynb)
  
### Ideal Farm Detection
- [Ideal Farm Detection](https://github.com/akbarsigit/Pedotan-MachineLearning/blob/main/cropCNN.ipynb)

## Model Performance
Models | Accuracy | Val Accuracy
